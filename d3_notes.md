D3 Notes: Data Driven Documents
Instructor: Courtney Wallace

Javascript: was started by Michael 

D3 is a JavaScript library, that uses HTML, SVG, and CSS, for manupulating documents based on data. 

Why do you use D3.js?
	- Its a great way to build whatever you want. 
	- Some frameworks are "opinionated" meaning it has constraints 
	
When do you use it? Anytime you want visualize data 

How can I get started? 
1. Acquire - Obtain the data, whether from a file on a disk or a soure over a network. They have to be in an array [ , , , ,]
2. Parse - Provide some structure for the data's meaning, and order it into categories. Put it into a json or csv
3. Filter - Remove all but the data of interest. Get all the ish out of there that you don't need. 
4. Mine - Apply methods from statistics or data mining as a way to discern patterns or place the data in mathematical context. (NEVER USE PIE CHART)
5. Represent - Choose a basic visual model, such as a bar graph, list, or tree.
6. Refine - Improve the basic representation to make it clearer and more visually engaging. Make sure axis are labeled and consistent 
7. Interact - Add methods for manupulating the data or controlling what features are visible. 

DOM - Document Object Model
SVG - Scalable Vector Graphic come in rectangle, circle, poly line (uses coordinates to create a line or shape), triangle ellipes, polygone, strait line 
Vector - made with paths
Raths - made with pixels

Programs:
qGIS - takes shape files and gives you geo json files
